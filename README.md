Atari 400/800 Star Raiders source code
======================================

This repository contains a transcribed copy of the printed (paper)
source code listing for the Atari 400/800 game "Star Raiders" published
in scanned-image format at:
https://archive.org/details/AtariStarRaidersSourceCode/Atari_Star_Raiders_Source_Code

The transcription is provided in the following three formats:

*   `annotated.txt`: The full transcribed listing, with annotations
    describing various observations about the program.  (As explained in
    the annotations, the symbol table present at the end of the original
    printed listing has been omitted from this transcription.)

*   `listing.txt`: The full transcribed listing, without annotations.

*   `source.txt`: The listing with the address-and-data column removed.
    This file is believed to be semantically identical to the file that
    would have been presented to the assembler used to create the ROM
    image for the released game.

`Makefile` is an auxiliary control file containing rules for generating
`listing.txt` and `source.txt` from `annotated.txt`.

Corrections and suggestions are welcome.
